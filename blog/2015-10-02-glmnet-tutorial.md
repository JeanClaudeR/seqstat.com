# GLMNet Tutorial
Recently, a friend informed me that something I created for [NC State's Statistical Learning Group](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/slg.html) comes up on a google search for "glmnet tutorial".  In fall 2014, I gave an introduction to penalized regression, focusing on LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net.  

The link that comes up is a tutorial on how to use R's well known [`glmnet`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/index.html) package.  Besides giving examples of how to use glmnet, it runs through a three simulations where there is a clear winner between the three competitors.

[Here is the glmnet tutorial](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/josh/LASSO_Ridge_Elastic_Net_-_Examples.html)
